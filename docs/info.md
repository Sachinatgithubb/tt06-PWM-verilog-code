## How it works
This project is to get variable width pulse at the output. The width of the output pulse may be bigger or smaller then the reference clock pulse. There are two different inputs namely increase_duty and decrease_duty. These inputs will be responsible for 10% change (increment/decrement) in the pulse width. The input frequency for this project is 50MHz.


## How to test

The design was run and tested on OpenROAD flow script (ORFS).
